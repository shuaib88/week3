# Game of Blackjack

# Simplified Rules (10 pts possible):
# - Human player gets the first two cards
# - Human player plays the rest of their hand
# - Then computer gets next two cards
# - Computer must take cards score  >= 17
# - Computer must stand when score >= 17
# - Aces always count as 11
# - Human player loses if their score is > 21
# - Computer loses if computer score is > 21
# - Human player wins immediately if their score is exactly 21
# - Computer wins immediately if their score is exactly 21
# - If computer score is betwen 17 and 20, winner is determined by score
# - If it's a tie, nobody wins.

# Grading:
# - 5 points for allowing a human user to play their complete hand
# - 5 points for allowing the computer to play its hand

# (Optional) Extras
# [You don't get extra credit for these, but they're fun.]
# - 1. Aces should count as 1 if counting as 11 would have made the score > 21
# - 2. Initally, human and dealer both get two cards; one dealer card is face up
# - 3. Allow the user to play as many games as they want
# - 4. Dealing cards to the cmputer should have a dramatic, 4-second delay

# Here's the psuedocode we wrote on the board in class:

## Get a deck of cards

SUITS = "\u2663 \u2665 \u2666 \u2660".split()
VALUES = "A 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 J Q K".split()

deck = []
for suit in SUITS:
  for face in VALUES:
    deck.append(face+suit)


## Shuffle the deck
import random
random.shuffle(deck)
print(deck)
print(len(deck))

## Calculate the score of the hand

def calculate_score(cards):
  value = 0
  for card in cards:
    face = card[:-1]
    if face in ['J', 'Q', 'K']:
      points = 10
    elif face == 'A':
      points = 11
    else:
      points = int(face)
    value += points
  return value
    

## Deal the first two cards to user
print()
hand = [deck.pop(0), deck.pop(0)]
print(hand)
print()
print(deck)
print(len(deck))

## User can choose to take cards as long as score < 21

## If user goes over 21, game is over - print you lose

## If user reaches 21, game is over - print you win

## If user less than 21, then it's the dealer's turn:


##    Computer takes two cards
##    Computer must take more cards while computer score < 17
##    If computer score reached 21, computer wins.
##    If computer score goes over 21, computer loses.
##    If computer score is 17 to 20, winner is determined by higher score.
